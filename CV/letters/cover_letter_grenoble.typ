To whom it might concern,

I am a student currently enrolled in the _Master's degree in Computer Engineering (subfield Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics)_ at Politecnico di Torino, Italy. I am a highly motivated student with a strong passion for artificial intelligence.

As I approach the end of my studies, I am looking for every opportunity to further develop my skills and knowledge and grow professionally and personally. In the double degree program between _Politecnico di Torino_ and the _University of Grenoble INP - Ensimag_, I see a great opportunity to achieve these goals. I already participated in an exchange program in the past at the _University of Oslo, Norway_, and I know from experience that living abroad and studying in a different environment helps greatly in that context. Compared to many other programs, the courses at _MSIAM_ seem very well structured and interesting and I really cannot wait to start. Ever since I signed up for my _Bachelor's in Computer Science_ I kept repeating that one day I'll get a _Master's degree in Mathematics_ and being able to continue studying what I am most passionate about, Artificial Intelligence, whilst getting closer to that goal feels like the perfect combination.

Having said all of that, my choice was further reinforced by the fact that the professor with whom I am doing an _extra curriculum Special Project_, mentioned to me that he has a thesis proposal at a research center in Grenoble Ensimag, and from a first look it seems very interesting.

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely\
Eduard Occhipinti
