Respected Shaukat Ali and Einar Broch Johnsen,

I would like to apply for internship under your supervision.
Professor Ferruccio Damiani introduced me to your work on digital twins, which I found fascinating.

I'm an undergraduate in the faculty in Computer Science, in these years I've learned a lot and I'm confident in my willingness to study and work hard to present myself as prepared as possible.
I've always been fascinated with computer simulations and the process of engineering effective models. 
The concept of using real-time data to create a more accurate virtual environment and the idea of distributing the computation over multiple machines is 
certainly something I wish to learn more about and surely something I'd love to work on in the future.

I have attached my resume.

Sincerely,
Eduard Occhipinti
