The fashion industry is beginning to find its feet again, but inequality in performance persists. A small group of leading brands are equalling, and in some cases already surpassing, their pre-pandemic performance.

The fashion industry is expected to make a full recovery by the end of 2021, much quicker than was originally anticipated. However, challenges relating to supply chain bottlenecks and uneven consumer demand continue to hang over the industry, undermining growth prospects.

COVID-19 has resulted in uneven economic recoveries across countries, regions, and cities, which fashion companies should take into account when considering their expansion priorities in a given market or refining their assortment mix across an existing retail footprint.

Despite a slowdown in GDP growth in recent years and a contraction of per capita income since 2014, international fashion retailers have continued to enter the South African market and, in some cases, have succeeded in taking market share from local chains. The middle class and lower-income groups in South Africa have been squeezed throughout the pandemic period, denting business at shopping centres, but hopes are high for a relatively fast recovery among some high-end mall executives.

The fashion industry is reliant on an intricate web of global supply chains that are seeing unprecedented levels of pressure and disruption. With logistical logjams, rising shipping costs and shortages of many kinds adding new layers of complexity, companies must rethink their sourcing strategies while implementing cutting-edge supply chain management, and building in greater flexibility to keep products flowing with customer demand in the year ahead.

Brands will aim to regain control of their supply chains while communicating potential delays with customers at each step. To keep a watchful eye on finances, they may also consider using a zero-based budgeting system, which requires all costs to be re-justified at each budget review.
