#_block(underline[NASA's definition of digital twin] + "\n" + "\"An integrated multiphysics, multiscale, probabilistic simulation of a veichle or system that uses the best available physical models, sensor updates, fleet history, etc., to mirror the life of its flying twin. It is ultra-realistic, and may consider one or more important and interdependant veichle systems\"")

A digital twin is a live replica of a Pysical System and is connected to it in real time, application. Digital Twins are meant to understand and control assets in nature, industry or society at large, they are meant to adapt as the underlying assets evolve with time. @smol

NASA was one of the first to introduce the concept of digital twins, however this research field still lacks any form of standardization, NASA's approach is a monolithic one, what we're trying to do with SMOL is provide a more flexible approach and the basis for a standard way to approach these kind of problems.

    == Applications
    Digital Twins are already exensively used in a wide range of fields, ranging from power generation equipment - like large engines, power generation turbines - to establish timeframes for regularly scheduled maintenance, to the health industry where they can be used profile patients and help tracking a variety of health indicators. @dtibm
